# University Portal #

Welcome to the University Portal! This application is designed to streamline communication and engagement between students and the department.

Features
1. Home Page
    --> Users can choose whether they would like to register or login depending on their user type (student or admin).
    Users must provide an email and password or else they cannot register/login and a toast message will be shown warning the user.
    If passwords are not more than six characters long, a toast message will appear to alert the user.

2. Program of Study (POSt) Checker
    --> Students can answer a few basic questions in a quiz format to check whether they qualify for a Program of Study (POSt).
    The POSt checker includes both the specialist and major requirements for the Computer and Mathematical Sciences (CMS) category and categories outside CMS, as well as the minor program.
    A message will appear on screen stating whether the user meets the POSt requirements based on the user's answers.

3. Complaints
    --> Students can submit complaints to communicate challenges they may be experiencing and admin can access and view these complaints. 

4. Announcements
    --> Admins can post about the latest updates and students receive notifications when updates are announced.
    When an admin posts an announcement (which includes a subject and description), the current time will be timestamped automatically. All announcements are ordered in descending order by date (with the latest announceemnt at the top).
    If the description is too long then it will be hidden and the full description is presented in a binding page.

6. Events
    --> Admins can schedule upcoming events, set participant limits, and manage RSVPs.
    Students can RSVP for upcoming events, ensuring they receive the latest updates and secure a spot if interested.
    After participating in an event, students have the opportunity to submit comments and numeric ratings, offering valuable feedback.
    Admins can access and review these comments, numeric ratings, and feedback.
